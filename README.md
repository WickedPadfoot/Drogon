##What is Drogon Project for

Dorgon is a web site to use if you play Dungeon and Dragon.
It's meant to be the place where a Master will be able to read the background of his players and also everything they'll write after games or when inspired.

##How it works 
After creating an account, you can create a character or a campaign. You can have as much as you want.
###Campaign
A campaign will have a name and a description, a context. This will be seen by every players you'll have. After creating your journey, you will be able to invite users to link a character with it. At this point, you will have acces to this character journal. You will also be able to send message to one or all players in your campaign.

We will suggest you somes, depending of your intelligence, but the choice will but yours. This should be representative of you in order to put roleplay in those writing.
